// Write a function that creates an array of numbers from 0 to 'n'
// Modify the function to take a number 'm' and then create an array of numbers from 'm' to 'n'
// Modify the function to only place in the array numbers evenly divisible by 5
// Modify the function to only place in the array numbers evenly divisible by 'k'
// Map the array. For each value in the array check if the value is evenly divisibile by 'i'
//    If the value is evenly divisible by 'i' place a 'true' value
//    If the value is not evenly divisible by 'i' place a 'false' value
